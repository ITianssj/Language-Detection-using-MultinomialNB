# Language-Detection-using-MultinomialNB

<p class="mb-30">Language Detection is the process of identifying the language of a given text. Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB) is a simple and efficient machine learning algorithm that can be used for language detection.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">MultinomialNB is a variant of Naive Bayes that is suitable for multiclass classification problems with discrete features. In language detection, the features can be the frequency of occurrence of each character or word in the text.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">In summary, MultinomialNB is a simple and efficient machine learning algorithm that can be used for language detection. By extracting features such as the frequency of occurrence of each character or word in the text, MultinomialNB can accurately classify thelanguage of a given text.language of a given text.language of a given text.</p>
